# PaperMeshTopo.jl

Tiny package to demonstrate management of mesh topology with the method described in the paper "Lightweight finite element mesh database in Julia" ( to be submitted).

To run these examples, clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/PaperMeshTopo.jl.git
```
and run one of the example files
```
fullonelevel.jl  
simpledown.jl        
simpledownup.jl 
```
The file `memoryplot.jl` produces the plot comparing memory usage in the paper.
